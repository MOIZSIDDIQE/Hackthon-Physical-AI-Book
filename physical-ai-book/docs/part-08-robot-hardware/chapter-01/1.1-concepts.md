- Connect hardware systems to physical AI integration

## Introduction

Humanoid robot hardware forms the physical foundation that enables anthropomorphic movement, interaction, and functionality. Unlike traditional industrial robots designed for specific tasks, humanoid robots must integrate multiple complex subsystems into a compact, lightweight, and energy-efficient package that mimics human form and function. The hardware design of humanoid robots presents unique challenges including weight distribution, power consumption, heat management, and structural integrity while maintaining the flexibility for diverse locomotion and manipulation tasks.

The hardware architecture of modern humanoid robots encompasses several critical subsystems: actuators for movement, sensors for perception and feedback, structural components for support and protection, power systems for energy delivery, and control systems for coordination. Each subsystem must be carefully designed and integrated to achieve the desired performance while meeting constraints of weight, power consumption, and safety.

Humanoid hardware design must balance competing requirements: high power density for dynamic movement, low weight for mobility, robust construction for durability, and sufficient space for sensors and computing resources. The anthropomorphic form factor adds complexity as components must fit within human-like proportions while providing the necessary degrees of freedom and functionality.

Modern humanoid hardware development focuses on modular designs that enable easier maintenance, upgrades, and customization. The field continues to evolve with advances in materials science, actuator technology, and miniaturization techniques that enable more capable and efficient humanoid robots.
