## Introduction

Biomechanics is the study of the structure, function, and motion of the mechanical aspects of biological systems. In humanoid robotics, understanding human biomechanics is essential for creating robots that can move naturally, efficiently, and safely in human environments. This chapter explores the mechanical principles underlying human movement and how these principles inform the design and control of humanoid robots.

## Fundamentals of Human Biomechanics

### Kinematic Chain Structure

The human body operates as a complex kinematic chain composed of rigid segments connected by joints:

#### Segment Characteristics
- **Rigid approximation**: While human segments are not perfectly rigid, they can be modeled as such for biomechanical analysis
- **Mass distribution**: Each segment has mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia properties
- **Segment lengths**: Proportional relationships that vary among individuals but follow statistical patterns

#### Joint Classification
Human joints can be classified according to their degrees of freedom:

```
Human Joint Classification:

1. Spherical Joints (Ball and Socket)
   • Examples: Shoulder, Hip
   • DOF: 3 (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction, internal/external rotation)
   • Range: Large workspace, high dexterity

2. Hinge Joints (Revolute)
   • Examples: Elbow, Knee
   • DOF: 1 (flexion/extension)
   • Range: Limited to single plane rotation

3. Pivot Joints (Condyloid)
   • Examples: Wrist, Ankle
   • DOF: 2 (flexion/extension, abduction/adduction)
   • Range: Planar movement with some rotation

4. Gliding Joints (Plane)
   • Examples: Intercarpal joints
   • DOF: 2-3 (limited translation and rotation)
   • Range: Small movements between adjacent surfaces
```

### Anthropometric Data

Understanding human body proportions is crucial for humanoid robot design:

#### Standard Proportions
Based on extensive anthropometric studies:

```
Human Body Proportions (relative to height):

Head: 1/8 of total height
Shoulder width: 1/4 of total height
Arm span: ~1.0 of total height
Upper arm: 18% of total height
Forearm: 16% of total height
Hand: 10% of total height
Trunk: 30% of total height
Thigh: 24% of total height
Shin: 22% of total height
Foot: 15% of total height

Mass Distribution:
Head: 7% of total body mass
Arms (each): 5% of total body mass
Trunk: 50% of total body mass
Thighs (each): 14% of total body mass
Shins (each): 4% of total body mass
Feet (each): 1% of total body mass
```

### Center of Mass and Balance

#### Human Center of Mass
- **Standing position**: Located approximately at the level of the second sacral vertebra (S2)
- **Horizontal position**: Slightly anterior to the spine, in the pelvic region
- **Vertical variation**: Changes with posture and limb position
- **Mass**: Approximately 55-85% of total body mass depending on individual characteristics

#### Balance Control Mechanisms
Humans maintain balance through multiple systems:
- **Visual system**: Provides orientation information
- **Vestibular system**: Detects head motion and orientation
- **Proprioceptive system**: Provides joint position and muscle tension information
- **Somatosensory system**: Provides tactile and pressure information

## Human Movement Patterns

### Walking Gait Analysis

#### Normal Walking Cycle
The human walking cycle consists of two main phases:

```
Walking Gait Cycle (100% cycle):

Stance Phase (60% of cycle):
• Initial Contact (0-2%): Heel strike
• Loading Response (2-12%): Weight acceptance
• Mid Stance (12-32%): Single limb support
• Terminal Stance (32-50%): Continued single support
• Pre-swing (50-60%): Preparation for swing

Swing Phase (40% of cycle):
• Initial Swing (60-73%): Acceleration
• Mid Swing (73-87%): Deceleration
• Terminal Swing (87-100%): Preparation for contact
```

#### Kinematic Patterns
During walking, specific joint patterns emerge:

```
Lower Extremity Joint Patterns:

Hip:
• Range: ~30° flexion to 10° extension
• Pattern: Flex during swing, extend during stance
• Function: Provide forward propulsion and ground clearance

Knee:
• Range: ~60° flexion during swing
• Pattern: Extend during stance, flex during swing
• Function: Shock absorption, ground clearance

Ankle:
• Range: ~15° dorsiflexion, ~20° plantarflexion
• Pattern: Dorsiflex during stance, plantarflex at push-off
• Function: Shock absorption, propulsion
```

### Upper Extremity Movement

#### Arm Coordination During Locomotion
Human arms exhibit natural coordination during walking:
- **Opposition**: Arms swing opposite to legs
- **Amplitude**: ~15° peak-to-peak movement
- **Function**: Counterbalance leg movement, maintain stability
- **Rhythm**: 2:1 ratio with leg movement (arm completes 2 cycles per leg cycle)

#### Reaching and Manipulation Patterns
Human reaching follows specific biomechanical principles:
- **Minimum jerk model**: Movements minimize jerk (third derivative of position)
- **Straight-line paths**: Endpoint trajectories are approximately straight
- **Velocity profiles**: Bell-shaped velocity curves
- **Joint coordination**: Multiple joints coordinate to achieve endpoint goals

## Biomechanical Principles for Robotics

### Inverse Dynamics

Understanding how forces and torques are generated in human movement:

#### Newton-Euler Formulation
For each body segment, the equations of motion are:

```
Translational Motion:
∑F = ma

Rotational Motion:
∑M = Iα + ω × (Iω)

Where:
F = forces acting on segment
M = moments acting on segment
m = segment mass
a = linear acceleration
I = moment of inertia tensor
α = angular acceleration
ω = angular velocity
```
