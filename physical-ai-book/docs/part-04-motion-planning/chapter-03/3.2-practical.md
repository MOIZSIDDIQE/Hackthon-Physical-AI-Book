# Dynamic Movement Planning - Practical Guide

## Introduction

This chapter provides practical guidance on implementing dynamic movement planning for humanoid robots. We'll cover hands-on approaches to creating efficient and adaptive movement plans.

## Key Implementation Steps

### 1. Dynamic Path Planning

To implement dynamic movement planning, you need to consider:

- Real-time obstacle detection and avoidance
- Dynamic replanning capabilities
- Time-optimal trajectory generation
- Multi-constraint optimization

### 2. Practical Implementation Approaches

For dynamic movement, implement:

- Model Predictive Control (MPC) for trajectory optimization
- Sampling-based algorithms for path planning
- Optimization techniques for smooth movement
- Real-time constraint handling

### 3. Control Integration

A typical dynamic movement system includes:

- High-level path planning
- Mid-level trajectory optimization
- Low-level motion execution
- Real-time adaptation mechanisms

## Implementation Example

```python
# Example of dynamic movement planning implementation
import numpy as np

class DynamicMovementPlanner:
    def __init__(self):
        self.current_pose = np.zeros(6)
        self.target_pose = np.zeros(6)
        self.obstacles = []

    def plan_dynamic_movement(self, start, goal, obstacles):
        # Plan optimal dynamic movement trajectory
        pass

    def adapt_to_changes(self, new_obstacles):
        # Adapt plan to new environmental changes
        pass
```

## Testing and Validation

### Simulation Testing

1. Test dynamic planning in various scenarios
2. Validate real-time replanning capabilities
3. Verify obstacle avoidance effectiveness
4. Check computational efficiency

### Real Robot Validation

1. Start with simple dynamic movements
2. Progress to complex obstacle avoidance
3. Test in dynamic environments
4. Validate computational constraints

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Planning Problems

- Check obstacle detection accuracy
- Verify planning algorithm parameters
- Adjust planning horizon
- Validate constraint definitions

### Execution Issues

- Verify controller integration
- Check timing constraints
- Validate trajectory feasibility
- Test on various platforms

## Best Practices

1. Use hierarchical planning approaches
2. Implement safety margins and failsafes
3. Use adaptive planning parameters
4. Monitor computational resources
5. Document planning parameters
