# 1.1 Motion Planning Fundamentals and Concepts

## Learning Objectives
- Understand fundamental motion planning principles for humanoid robots
- Analyze configuration spaces and path planning algorithms
- Master sampling-based and optimization-based planning methods
- Apply motion planning concepts to humanoid manipulation and locomotion
- Connect planning concepts to physical AI systems

## Introduction

Motion planning forms the computational foundation that enables humanoid robots to navigate their environment and execute complex tasks while avoiding collisions and respecting physical constraints. Unlike traditional mobile robots that operate in 2D or 3D spaces, humanoid robots must plan motions in high-dimensional configuration spaces that account for the degrees of freedom in their multi-joint bodies. This complexity is further compounded by the need to maintain balance, coordinate multiple limbs, and operate in dynamic human environments.

The challenge in humanoid motion planning lies in the high-dimensional nature of the configuration space, which typically includes 20-30 degrees of freedom for the robot's joints. Additionally, humanoid robots must consider constraints such as balance maintenance, joint limits, obstacle avoidance, and dynamic stability. These requirements make motion planning for humanoid robots significantly more complex than for simpler robotic systems.

Motion planning in humanoid robotics encompasses several key areas: global path planning for navigation, local obstacle avoidance for dynamic environments, manipulation planning for object interaction, and locomotion planning for walking and climbing. Each of these areas requires specialized approaches that account for the unique characteristics of humanoid robots and their operating environments.

The ultimate goal of motion planning for humanoid robots is to generate collision-free, dynamically feasible trajectories that allow the robot to achieve its goals while respecting all physical and environmental constraints. Success depends on balancing planning accuracy with computational efficiency, ensuring that the robot can respond to dynamic changes in its environment while maintaining safety and stability.

## 2. Configuration Space and Robot Representation

### Configuration Space (C-Space) Fundamentals

The configuration space (C-space) represents all possible configurations of a robot, where each point corresponds to a unique pose of the robot. For a humanoid robot with n joints, the configuration space is typically an n-dimensional space where each dimension corresponds to a joint angle or position.

**Free Configuration Space (C_free)**: The subset of C-space that contains collision-free configurations, excluding those where the robot collides with obstacles or itself.

**Obstacle Configuration Space (C_obs)**: The subset of C-space where the robot would be in collision with environmental obstacles.

The dimensionality of the configuration space for humanoid robots makes direct geometric reasoning impractical, necessitating sophisticated sampling and optimization techniques.

### Robot Modeling for Planning

Humanoid robots are typically modeled as kinematic chains with multiple branches (arms, legs, torso) connected at joints. Each link has associated geometric properties (shape, size, mass) that must be considered during planning. The robot's configuration is defined by the set of joint angles θ = [θ₁, θ₂, ..., θₙ], which determines the position and orientation of every point on the robot.

## 3. Path Planning Fundamentals

### Basic Path Planning Concepts

**Path**: A continuous sequence of configurations connecting a start state to a goal state.

**Trajectory**: A path parameterized by time, including velocity and acceleration profiles.

**Complete Algorithm**: An algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution if one exists, or report failure if no solution exists.

**Probabilistically Complete Algorithm**: An algorithm that approaches finding a solution with probability 1 as computation time approaches infinity.

### Planning Problem Formulation

The motion planning problem can be formally defined as:
- **Input**: Start configuration q_start, goal region Q_goal, obstacle space C_obs
- **Output**: Continuous path σ: [0,1] → C_free such that σ(0) = q_start and σ(1) ∈ Q_goal

The path must lie entirely within the free configuration space and satisfy all kinematic and dynamic constraints.

## 4. Sampling-Based Planning Methods

### Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)

PRM is a multi-query planning algorithm that precomputes a roadmap of the environment:
1. **Sampling**: Randomly sample configurations in the free space
2. **Connection**: Connect nearby configurations that can be joined by collision-free paths
3. **Query**: Find path between start and goal using the precomputed roadmap

PRM is efficient for environments with many queries but requires significant preprocessing time.

### Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)

RRT grows a tree of configurations from the start position by randomly sampling the configuration space:
1. **Random Sampling**: Sample random configuration in C-space
2. **Nearest Neighbor**: Find closest configuration in existing tree
3. **Extension**: Extend tree toward random sample using small steps
4. **Collision Checking**: Verify extension is collision-free

RRT variants include RRT*, which provides asymptotic optimality, and bidirectional RRT, which grows trees from both start and goal.

### Rapidly-exploring Random Graphs (RRG)

RRG extends RRT by maintaining a graph structure and rewiring to improve path quality. This approach provides both probabilistic completeness and asymptotic optimality.

## 5. Optimization-Based Planning

### Trajectory Optimization

Optimization-based planners formulate planning as a constrained optimization problem:
```
min ∫₀ᵀ L(x(t), u(t)) dt
s.t. ẋ(t) = f(x(t), u(t))
      g(x(t), u(t)) ≤ 0
      x(0) = x_start
      x(T) = x_goal
```

Where L is the cost function, f represents system dynamics, and g represents constraints.

### CHOMP (Covariant Hamiltonian Optimization for Motion Planning)

CHOMP optimizes trajectories by iteratively improving an initial guess using gradient-based optimization while maintaining collision avoidance through a smooth penalty function.

### STOMP (Stochastic Trajectory Optimization for Motion Planning)

STOMP uses stochastic optimization to find optimal trajectories, adding random perturbations to escape local minima while maintaining feasibility.

## 6. Humanoid-Specific Planning Challenges

### High-Dimensional Configuration Space

Humanoid robots operate in 20-30 dimensional configuration spaces, making planning computationally expensive. Dimensionality reduction techniques and decoupled planning approaches help manage this complexity.

### Balance and Stability Constraints

Humanoid robots must maintain balance during motion, requiring planning algorithms to consider Center of Mass (CoM) position and Zero Moment Point (ZMP) constraints.

### Multi-Task Coordination

Planning must coordinate multiple tasks simultaneously: reaching with arms, walking with legs, maintaining balance, and looking at targets.

### Dynamic Planning

Many humanoid applications require real-time replanning to handle dynamic obstacles and changing goals.

## 7. Planning for Different Robot Capabilities

### Manipulation Planning

Manipulation planning focuses on planning arm motions to achieve tasks like reaching, grasping, and manipulating objects. This includes:
- **Reach Planning**: Finding joint configurations to position end-effectors
- **Grasp Planning**: Determining stable grasps and manipulation sequences
- **Collision-Free Path Planning**: Avoiding obstacles during manipulation

### Locomotion Planning

Locomotion planning generates walking, stepping, or climbing patterns:
- **Footstep Planning**: Determining optimal foot placement locations
- **Walking Pattern Generation**: Creating dynamically stable walking patterns
- **Terrain Adaptation**: Adjusting for uneven or unknown terrain

### Whole-Body Planning

Whole-body planning coordinates all robot degrees of freedom simultaneously, considering:
- **Kinematic Constraints**: Joint limits and velocity limits
- **Dynamic Constraints**: Balance and stability requirements
- **Task Priorities**: Managing multiple simultaneous objectives

## 8. Planning with Uncertainty

### Probabilistic Roadmaps with Uncertainty

Planning under uncertainty considers sensor noise, actuator errors, and environmental uncertainty. This includes:
- **Probabilistic collision checking**: Considering the probability of collision
- **Robust planning**: Planning paths that are insensitive to uncertainty
- **Reactive planning**: Planning that adapts to unexpected changes

### Stochastic Motion Planning

Stochastic planners account for uncertainties in robot motion and environmental conditions, using probabilistic models to ensure successful execution despite disturbances.

## 9. Real-Time Planning Considerations

### Computational Complexity

Motion planning algorithms must balance solution quality with computational requirements:
- **Anytime algorithms**: Provide progressively better solutions over time
- **Hierarchical planning**: Use coarse-to-fine approaches for efficiency
- **Parallel processing**: Exploit multi-core architectures for speed

### Dynamic Replanning

Real-world applications require the ability to replan when:
- Obstacles appear or move
- Goals change
- Execution errors occur
- Environmental conditions change

## 10. Planning Quality Metrics
