# Recommended Hardware Components for Labs

This list provides recommendations for affordable and widely available hardware components to accompany the practical labs in the "Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book".

## 1. Microcontrollers

-   **Arduino Uno R3**: Excellent for beginners, widely documented, and robust.
    -   *Purpose*: Basic sensor input, motor control, LED manipulation.
-   **Raspberry Pi (e.g., Raspberry Pi 4 Model B or Zero 2 W)**: More powerful, capable of running Linux and ROS2.
    -   *Purpose*: Advanced control, running Python scripts, integrating with higher-level AI.

## 2. Sensors

-   **Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)**: For distance measurement.
    -   *Purpose*: Obstacle detection, basic navigation.
-   **PIR Motion Sensor (HC-SR501)**: For detecting movement.
    -   *Purpose*: Presence detection, simple reactive behaviors.
-   **Line Tracking Sensor (e.g., TCRT5000 based)**: For following lines.
    -   *Purpose*: Line-following robots, path guidance.
-   **Small Breadboard-compatible Camera Module (e.g., OV7670 or Raspberry Pi Camera Module)**: For basic computer vision.
    -   *Purpose*: Object detection, color tracking (with Raspberry Pi).

## 3. Actuators

-   **SG90 Micro Servo Motor**: Small, inexpensive, and easy to control.
    -   *Purpose*: Articulation of small joints, camera pan/tilt.
-   **DC Motor with Gearbox (e.g., N20 Micro Gear Motor)**: For driving wheels or stronger movements.
    -   *Purpose*: Mobile robot locomotion.
-   **L298N Motor Driver Module**: Required for controlling DC motors with microcontrollers.
    -   *Purpose*: Interface between microcontroller and higher-current motors.

## 4. Other Components

-   **LEDs (various colors)**: Simple visual feedback.
-   **Resistors (various values)**: For current limiting with LEDs and other circuits.
-   **Breadboard**: For prototyping circuits.
-   **Jumper Wires (Male-to-Male, Male-to-Female)**: For connecting components.
-   **USB Cables**: For programming Arduino, powering Raspberry Pi.
-   **Power Supply**: Compatible with chosen microcontroller (e.g., 5V, 2A for Raspberry Pi).

## Where to Buy

These components are widely available from online electronics retailers such as Adafruit, SparkFun, Amazon, AliExpress, and local hobby electronics stores.
