# AI Humanoid Book Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Target Audience: Beginners
The book is specifically designed for individuals with little to no prior experience in AI, robotics, or programming. Content MUST be accessible and avoid advanced jargon without thorough explanation.

### II. Step-by-Step Learning Approach
All tutorials and explanations MUST follow a clear, sequential, step-by-step methodology. Complex topics will be broken down into manageable segments, gradually building proficiency. A blend of simulation and real hardware examples will be used to reinforce learning.

### III. Clear, Engaging & Visual Style
Content MUST be easy to understand, utilizing simple language, compelling visual diagrams, and clear, well-commented example code. The style will prioritize clarity and engagement over technical complexity.

### IV. Practical Learning Outcomes
Each section and chapter MUST aim for measurable learning outcomes, enabling readers to grasp fundamental AI and robotics concepts, develop practical simulation skills, and gain basic experience in integrating with physical hardware.

## Content Guidelines

All content MUST be original or properly attributed. Technical accuracy and safety are paramount for hardware-related instructions. Ethical considerations for AI and robotics MUST be addressed.

## Review and Quality Assurance

Content MUST undergo technical review by subject matter experts and pedagogical review for clarity and effectiveness for a beginner audience. All code examples MUST be tested and verified as functional.

## Governance

The project constitution is the supreme governing document for development practices and architectural decisions. All design, implementation, and review processes MUST verify compliance with these principles.
*   **Amendment Procedure**: Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal, review by core contributors, and a majority approval. Significant changes (MAJOR version bumps) also require explicit stakeholder sign-off.
*   **Versioning Policy**: This constitution adheres to semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH).
    *   MAJOR: Backward-incompatible changes, removal of principles, or fundamental redefinitions.
    *   MINOR: Addition of new principles, significant expansions of guidance, or new sections.
    *   PATCH: Clarifications, wording improvements, typo fixes, or non-semantic refinements.
*   **Compliance Review**: Regular compliance reviews (at least quarterly) MUST be conducted to ensure ongoing adherence to all principles and guidelines.
