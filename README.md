# AI Humanoid Robotics Book Project

This repository contains a comprehensive guide to Physical AI Humanoid Robotics, designed for beginners to learn fundamental concepts, practical implementation, and real-world applications.

## Project Structure

- `book/` - Contains the main content of the robotics book with chapters and labs
- `specs/` - Feature specifications, plans, and tasks following Spec-Driven Development methodology
- `history/` - Prompt History Records and Architectural Decision Records
- `simulations/` - Robotics simulation environments and examples
- `hardware_examples/` - Hardware component examples and configurations
- `src/` - Source code examples and implementations
- `tests/` - Test suites for verifying implementations
- `tools/` - Utility tools for development and testing

## About the Book

The Physical AI Humanoid Robotics Book covers everything from basic robotics principles to advanced AI integration and human-robot interaction. It includes:

- 10 comprehensive chapters covering all aspects of humanoid robotics
- Hands-on laboratory exercises for each chapter
- Practical implementation examples using ROS2, Gazebo, and other tools
- Case studies of real-world humanoid robots

## Getting Started

To get started with the content, navigate to the `book/` directory where you'll find the complete table of contents and all chapters organized with their respective labs.

## Development Methodology

This project follows Spec-Driven Development (SDD) principles with:
- Detailed feature specifications in the `specs/` directory
- Comprehensive planning and task breakdowns
- Prompt History Records (PHRs) for tracking all development decisions
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for significant technical choices

## Target Audience

- Students and researchers in robotics
- Engineers looking to transition into robotics
- Hobbyists interested in humanoid robots
- Anyone curious about AI and robotics integration
